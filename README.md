# Clipper
Send to android device a text to paste into the clipboard through adb

# Installation

1. Install apk file into own device
2. Activate USB Debug from Developer Option

# Uses

1. Open CMD in the folder of the program
2. Execute clipper.exe "what you want to paste..." or win+r: clipper "read utilites for this way"
3. Press Enter and it's done!

# Utilities

I recommend to insert clipper as new environment variable (set as variable name 'clipper' and as value the full path of the application clippe.exe) so you can execute the script on every place or simply with the shell
win + r -> clipper "done"

If you have any problems with the clipper.exe you can simply use the batch file clipper.bat
